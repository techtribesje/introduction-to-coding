# 1. Displaying Text
This is how you display text on the screen with Python.```pythonprint("We love monkeys")
```- print() tells Python to display text- "We love monkeys" is the text to be displayed
# 2. Displaying lots of textYou can tell Python to do something a number of times.￼￼
```pythonfor i in range(1,11):
  print("We love monkeys")```
- i is a variable and the value of it changes each timeTry this.

```pythonfor i in range(1,11):
  print(i)
```

# 3. Variables
You can think of a variable as being like a tiny cardboard box that you can give a name to and put something inside of. Let’s create a variable called name and give it a value of "George".

```python
nname = "George" 
print("Hello", name); 
```

# 4. Maths
Python lets you add things together with the + symbol.

```python
total = 1 
total = total + 2 
print("The total is", total) 
```

Try these other maths operators to see what they do: - * / % **

# 5. Adding numbers from 1 to 100
You now have everything that you need to write a simple program that counts from 1 to 100, adds up all of those numbers and displays the total. Good luck!

# 6. Adding even numbers from 1 to 100
If you finished that, change your code so that it only adds up the even numbers between 1 and 100.

```python
finished = true 
if (finished == true) 
  puts "change your code to only add even numbers" 
end
```

# 7. FizzBuzz
And if you finished that too, write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, but:

- for multiples of three, print "Fizz" instead of the number
- for multiples of five, print "Buzz" instead of the number
- for multiples of three and five, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number

In other words:

```
1 
2 
Fizz 
4 
Buzz 
Fizz 
7 
8 
Fizz 
Buzz 
11 
Fizz 
13 
14 
FizzBuzz
```
